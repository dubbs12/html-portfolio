<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="../assets/images/TinoTie.jpeg" height="200"/>

<p>I am an aspiring full-stack web developer. I have a B.S. in Computer Science and earned my Certificate as a Full Stack
   Web Developer through AppBrewery's 2023 Full Stack Web Developer course on Udemy.
</p>

<p>I'm a veteran and served 7 1/2 years total between the U.S. Navy and the Texas Army National Guard. I'm married to a wonderful
  woman I affectionately refer to as Chickadita. We don't have any children, but we do have three felines we think of as kiddos.
</p>

<p>I pursued my certification as a web developer so I could create my own crowdfunding platform
  to help smaller Catholic parishes and religious communities pay off their debt, fund new capital
  campaigns, and meet their day-to-day needs.
